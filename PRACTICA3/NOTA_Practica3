Document: - No introduction - General conclusions are missing (See the indications in both the statement of the lab assignment and the rubrics for the generic competence). Taskloop: [Additional comment: grainsize(8) may not be optimal. Next time try several values to adjust the best granularity) ]. - for+schedule(dynamic,10) An speedup around 20 with 8 threads is reported, but the lack of a source code prevents from understanding which error was made. No source files attached when they are clearly requested in the document. Since the Source code is missing and I cannot provide feedback about the weird results with: - for+schedule(dynamic,10) - optional 1: collapse(2) Optional part done but partially correct: +0.25 (No source code provided to understand the problem w.r.t. implications on performance) Structure of the document: -0.25 (Neither introduction nor general conclusions) Technical content: 1.75
